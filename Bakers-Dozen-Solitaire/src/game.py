game.py

Main game logic and loop for Baker's Dozen Solitaire.

Responsibilities:
- Initializes and runs the game session (random or from file)
- Handles player input (drag/drop, hints, undo)
- Manages card rendering, animations, and visual effects
- Tracks game progress, scoring, and win/loss conditions
- Supports game replays and end-of-game options

Key Modules Used:
- GameState: logic and rule enforcement
- Deck: shuffling and dealing
- Button: UI button rendering and interaction
- Config: layout constants and styles
- Replay: move playback
- File Interaction: logging and loading game state
- End Game: draw end screen

Entry point: run_game()
